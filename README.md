Fortress Forever free for all death match.

This is a port from a Half-life map I made 10+ years ago. It offers arena style deathmatch, where you must find your weapons and pits everyone against each other.

Make sure your server config "mp_friendlyfire" is defaulted to "0", otherwise it will turn friendly on after the map is played. If you like friendly fire on, then do nothing.
